| [![](./Photos/Thumbnails/20200311_183000.jpg)](./Photos/20200311_183000.jpg) | I got [Ponoko](https://make.ponoko.com) to laser cut the basic shape out of their 3mm thick [amber bamboo plywood](https://www.ponoko.com/materials/amber-bamboo-plywood). 3mm is not going to be thick enough for the screw in hooks, but I can glue multiple pieces together. I got 5 pieces made but only needed to use 4 of them to get the board thick enough. |
| [![](./Photos/Thumbnails/20200328_182641.jpg)](./Photos/20200328_182641.jpg) | I stained the wood with  and stuck five screw in hooks into the 5 little holes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [![](./Photos/Thumbnails/20200328_182850.jpg)](./Photos/20200328_182850.jpg) | I put some some double sided tape on the back ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
